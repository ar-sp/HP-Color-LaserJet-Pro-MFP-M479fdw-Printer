HP Color LaserJet Pro MFP M479fdw Setup Guide
=============================================

Step 1: Unbox the Printer
-------------------------

Before starting the installation process, make sure you have a clean and stable surface to place the printer. Unbox the HP Color LaserJet Pro MFP M479fdw carefully to avoid damaging any components. Here’s how to get started:

- **Remove all Packaging Materials:** Open the box and take out the printer. Be sure to remove any protective packaging, such as plastic wrap, tape, and foam inserts that may be securing the printer during shipping.
- **Check the Included Accessories:** The box should include the printer, power cord, starter toner cartridges (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black), a control panel guide, and a manual. Ensure all components are present before proceeding.
- **Place the Printer:** Put the printer on a flat, stable surface near a power source and within range of your Wi-Fi router (if you are setting up a wireless connection).

Step 2: Install the Toner Cartridges
------------------------------------

The HP Color LaserJet Pro MFP M479fdw uses four toner cartridges, one for each color: black, cyan, magenta, and yellow. These are usually provided as starter cartridges in the box.

To install the toner cartridges:

- Open the Front Door: Locate the front door of the printer. Open it carefully to access the toner cartridge area.
- Remove Protective Packaging: Take each toner cartridge out of its packaging and remove any protective tape or plastic covers.
- Insert the Toner Cartridges: Insert each toner cartridge into its corresponding slot. The cartridges are color-coded, so ensure you match the colors of the cartridges (black, cyan, magenta, and yellow) with the colored labels in the printer.
- Close the Front Door: Once all the toner cartridges are securely in place, close the front door of the printer.

Step 3: Load Paper into the Input Tray
--------------------------------------

Now, you need to load paper into the printer’s input tray so it can begin printing. The HP Color LaserJet Pro MFP M479fdw can handle various paper sizes, including letter, legal, and A4. Follow these steps to load paper:

- Slide Out the Input Tray: Pull out the input tray located at the bottom of the printer.
- Adjust the Paper Guides: Adjust the paper width and length guides to fit the size of the paper you’re using. Make sure the paper is aligned correctly in the tray.
- Load the Paper: Place the paper into the tray. Avoid overloading the tray, as this can cause jams or misfeeds. Ensure that the paper is stacked neatly and not bent.
- Slide the Tray Back In: Once the paper is loaded, slide the input tray back into place, ensuring it’s securely fitted.

Step 4: Connect the Printer to Power
------------------------------------

- Plug in the Power Cord: Insert the power cord into the printer’s power port, and plug the other end into a nearby power outlet.
- Turn On the Printer: Press the power button, usually located on the right-hand side of the printer’s control panel. The printer will go through its startup process and initialize.

Step 5: Connect the Printer to a Network
----------------------------------------

The HP Color LaserJet Pro MFP M479fdw offers multiple ways to connect to your computer or network, including wireless and wired connections. Below are the steps for both options:

**Option 1: Wireless Setup**

To connect the printer to your Wi-Fi network:

- Access the Control Panel: On the printer's control panel, tap on the “Wireless” icon or go to the Setup menu (gear icon) on the screen.
- Select Wireless Settings: Find the "Wireless Setup Wizard" or "Network Setup" option and tap on it. This will allow the printer to search for available Wi-Fi networks.
- Select Your Wi-Fi Network: Choose your Wi-Fi network from the list of available networks. Enter the Wi-Fi password using the touchscreen keypad when prompted, and tap "OK."
- Confirmation: Once connected, the printer will confirm that it is connected to the network. The wireless icon will show as active, and you should be able to print from any device on the same network.

**Option 2: Wired (Ethernet) Setup**

If you prefer a wired connection, the printer supports Ethernet networking:

- Connect the Ethernet Cable: Plug one end of an Ethernet cable into the printer's Ethernet port and the other end into your router or network switch.
- Access the Printer’s Settings: Follow the on-screen instructions on the printer’s display to configure the network settings.
- Confirm Connection: After successfully connecting, the printer should indicate that it’s connected to your local area network (LAN).

Step 6: Install Printer Drivers and Software
--------------------------------------------

Now that the printer is connected to your network or computer, the next step is to install the necessary printer drivers and software on your computer. You can install the drivers via the CD included in the box or by downloading them from the printer's built-in menu.
